          Working on Edulink was super fun! It was a great opportunity to learn
          and grow in the field of web development. Working with a team of
          talented developers was a great experience.

          My favorite feature is ability to login via localstorage and json
          data. It adds a new level of security and convenience for users.

          One of my favorite parts was designing and developing the event page.
          These sections play an important role in making the platform more
          organized and user-friendly.
